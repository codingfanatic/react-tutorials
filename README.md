>JavaScript Syntax

>Component Hierarchy

>Props and Custom props

States

>States

>Constructors

Style

>In an array, the last style will ALWAYS take precedence over others. 

Size

>The size of each View component can be explicitly styled

>Fixed dimensions are ideal for components set to render at the exact same size regardless of the size of the screen

>Flex defines the height of a component. It is a ratio compared to other components on screen.

>Removing the parent flex prevents the child components from rendering since it won't have any dimensions

>Changing the parent height causes child components to render inside an area defined by the size of the parent

Flexbox

>Flexbox is designed to display consistent layouts on different sized screens

>flexDirection determines the primary axis of a layout

>FlexDirections organize child components vertically (column) by default. Row organizes them horizontally.
