>Constructors

04 Style

>In an array, the last style will ALWAYS take precedence over others. 

05.1 Size

>The size of each View component can be explicitly styled

>Fixed dimensions are ideal for components set to render at the exact same size regardless of the size of the screen

>Flex defines the height of a component. It is a ratio compared to other components on screen.

>Removing the parent flex prevents the child components from rendering since it won't have any dimensions

>Changing the parent height causes child components to render inside an area defined by the size of the parent

05.2 Flexbox

>Flexbox is designed to display consistent layouts on different sized screens

06.1 FlexDirection

>flexDirection determines the primary axis of a layout

>FlexDirections organize child components vertically (column) by default. Row organizes them horizontally.

06.2 Justify Content

>justifyContent determines the way children components are distributed along the primary axis of the parent component

>Options include flex-start, center, flex-end, space-around, space-between and space-evenly.

06.3 Align Items

>alignItems determines the alignment of children along the secondary axis

>If primary is row, secondary is column and vice versa

>Options: flex-start, center, flex-end, and stretch.

>components only stretch when they don't have fixed dimensions on the secondary axis

07.1 Input Text

>TextInput is a component which allows users to enter text

>onChangeText is a prop called every time the text is changed

08.1 Buttons

>Button component has an onPress prop for defining actions performed when pressed

>The title prop is the text displayed inside the button

08.2 Touches

>TouchableHighlight is ideal wherever links/buttons would go. The background darkens when touched

>TouchableNativeFeedback displays an ink surface with ripples when touched

>TouchableOpacity reduces the opacity of the button showing the background to be seen through while pressed down

>TouchableWithoutFeedback is a super basic button which doesn't react when touched

09 ScrollViews

>ScrollViews are generic scrolling containers which can host multiple components/views

>Able to scroll horizontal by setting the horizontal property

>Best for displaying a small amount of things of a limited size

>FlatList component is better for a longer list

10.1 FlatLists

>FlatList component displays a scrolling list of changing and similarly structured data

>Good for long lists where the quantity of items might change

>Only renders what is on screen while ScrollView renders everything at once

>Props include data and renderItem.

>data is the source of info for the list

>renderItem takes an item from the source and returns a formatted component to render

>The FlatListBasics component then renders the FlatList and all Text components.

10.2 SectionLists

>SectionLists break up information into lists in different sections

>This program shows names sorted under different letters, like the list of contacts.

11 Networking

>Fetching allows an app to load resources from a remote URL
